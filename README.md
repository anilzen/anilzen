### Hi ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ After an almost 8-year research break, I'm getting back to scientific productivity.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about new imaging technologies for neurons and cancer cells, Helmholtz equations, gravitational waves in de Sitter spacetimes, and second-order self-force.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on solving Maxwell equations for applied problems in unbounded domains (for example, radar cross sections of airplanes).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about hyperboloidal foliations.
- ðŸ“« Reach me at anil@umd.edu
