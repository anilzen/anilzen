### Hi ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm a scientist working on black holes, gravitational waves, and partial differential equations.
- ðŸŒ± My main interest is in exploring the implications of a hyperboloidal separation of spacetime into space and time. Lately, I've been working on wave equations in applied problems (to replace perfectly matched layers with compactification at null infinity), cosmology (to perform black hole perturbation theory in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes), and hyperbolic geometry in quantum field theory (just curious, can we use compactification in lattice calculations?).
- ðŸ‘¯ If you're interested in any of the above topics, just email me.
